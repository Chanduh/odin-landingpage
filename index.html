      <h1>Hello there!</h1>
      <p>I'm Chanda and I've been persuing tattooing as a career for over 17 years! I've spent even longer than that being passionate about web & graphic design. I spent many nights in my youth (yes, entire nights!) tweaking and revamping layouts for my personal satisfaction (and the one or two people who would ever see them).</p>
      <p>I've decided the time has come to switch gears and focus more on my webdesign interets. I am currently going the self-taught route (if you consider crushing tutorials "self"-teaching) and plan to be in the game professionally within the next year.</p>
      <p> I'd love to talk, meet, connect, work & collaborate with you!</p>
